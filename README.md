# HOMEOWNERSHIP

35 Arts (in various ways) 5 at a time.

First owners: get a Voxel sculpture as a gift.

2X meaning: interpret as you wish. Sell for double maybe?

Goal: Help me buy a house for my mom.

Comments:

*Download is free

*The voxel is a gift, it is an affective memory, but it can be sold you are free to do what you want.
